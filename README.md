Light rate limting within PHP using Redis.
</div>

Limitrr PHP is very heavily inspired by my other library, Limitrr which was created for NodeJS. Check it out [here](http://github.com/eddiejibson/chae-limitrr)

Limitrr PHP allows users to easily integrate rate limiting within their application. Unlike other similar packages, this utility allows the user to limit not only by the number of requests but also the number of completed actions (e.g allowing a certain amount of accounts to be successfully created within a timespan) and have such restricted with custom options. As well as this, custom discriminators are possible - you no longer have to limit by just the user's IP.

This library also provides a middleware function for easily ratelimting whatever various routes you may have within a SlimPHP project.

If you appreciate this project, please ðŸŒŸ it on GitHub.

## Installation

You can install the limitrr-php libary via executing the following commandline in your terminal:

```bash
composer require eddiejibson/limitrr-php
```

## Quick Guide

### Basic Usage

```php
require "/vendor/autoload.php"; //Require composer's autoload

$options = [
    "routes" => [
        "default" => [
            "requestsPerExpiry" => 5,
        ],
    ],
    "redis" => [
        "host" => "666.chae.sh",
        "port" => 6379,
        "password" => "supersecret",
    ],
];

$limitrr = new new \eddiejibson\limitrr\Limitrr($options)


//Usage within SlimPHP
$app = new Slim\App();

//Use the Limitrr SlimPHP middleware function, if you wish:
$app->add(new \eddiejibson\limitrr\RateLimitMiddleware($limitrr)); //Make sure to pass in the main Limitrr
//instance we defined above into the middleware function

//You can also add the get IP middleware function, it will append the user's real IP (behind Cloudflare or not)
//to the request.
$app->add(new \eddiejibson\limitrr\getIpMiddleware());

//Example usage within a route
$app->get("/hello/{name}", function ($request, $response, $args) {
    $name = $args["name"];
    $ip = $request->getAttribute('realip'); //Get the IP that was defined within Limitrr's get IP middleware function
    return $response->getBody()->write("Hello, ${name}. Your IP is ${ip}.");
});

//You do not have to app the middleware function to every single route, globally.
//You can do it indivually, too - along with passing options into such. Like so:
$app->get("/createUser/{name}", function ($request, $response, $args) {

})->add(new \eddiejibson\limitrr\RateLimitMiddleware($limitrr, ["route"=>"createUser"]));

$app->run();
```
